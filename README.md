# fast_push bruh', cuz we aint no time to loose
A script to make to make the process of add all content, commit, push in two letters.

1. Make the file executable by running the command '```chmod +x fpush.sh'``` (replace myscript.sh with the name of your script file).
2. Create an alias for the script by adding the following line to your Bash profile file (usually located at ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile):

```alias myalias='/path/to/fpush.sh'```

I want to type ```fp``` and get my stuff pushed, so: 


```alias fp='/path/to/fpush.sh'```


3. Replace /path/to/myscript.sh with the full path to your script file.
4. Now you can run the script by typing myalias in the terminal. The script will prompt you to enter a commit message before committing and pushing the changes.
